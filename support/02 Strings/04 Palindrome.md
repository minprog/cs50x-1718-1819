# emordnilaPalindrome {#palindrome}

## Goal

Write a program that takes a string from the user and determines if it is a palindrome (a word that is the same spelled backwards).


    $ ./palindrome
    Type something: Never odd or even
    The text "Never odd or even" is a palindrome


## Specification
- Create a file called `palindrome.c` in your `~/workspace/section2/` directory.
- Compile the program with the command `make palindrome`.
- Make sure your program is not case sensitive.
