= Homepage

== tl;dr

Build a simple homepage using HTML and CSS.

== Background

The internet has enabled incredible things: we can use a search engine to research anything imaginable, communicate with friends and family members around the globe, play games, take courses, and so much more. But it turns out that nearly all pages we may visit are built on three core languages, each of which serves a slightly different purpose:

1. HTML, or _HyperText Markup Language_, which is used to describe the content of websites;
1. CSS, _Cascading Style Sheets_, which is used to describe the aesthetics of websites; and
1. JavaScript, which is used to make websites interactive and dynamic.

Focusing on just the first two of those three languages for now, create a simple homepage that introduces yourself, your favorite hobby or extracurricular, or anything else of interest to you.

== Getting Started

Here's how to download this problem's "distribution code" (i.e., starter code) into your own CS50 IDE. Log into link:https://cs50.io/[CS50 IDE] and then, in a terminal window, execute each of the below.

1. Execute `cd` to ensure that you're in `~/workspace/` (i.e., a directory called `workspace` that's in your home directory, aka `~`).
1. Execute `mkdir section` to make (i.e., create) a directory called `section` in your home directory.
1. Execute `cd section` to change into (i.e., open) that directory.
1. Execute `wget http://cdn.cs50.net/2018/fall/psets/5/homepage/homepage.zip` to download a (compressed) ZIP file with this problem's distribution.
1. Execute `unzip homepage.zip` to uncompress that file.
1. Execute `rm homepage.zip` followed by `yes` or `y` to delete that ZIP file.
1. Execute `ls`. You should see a directory called `homepage`, which was inside of that ZIP file.
1. Execute `cd homepage` to change into that directory.
1. Execute `ls`. You should see this problem's distribution, including `index.html` and `styles.css`.
1. You can immediately start a server to view the site by typing
+
```
http-server
```
+
in the terminal window and copying the link that appears, which should be of the form `http://ide50-USERNAME.cs50.io:8080`, substituting, of course, your actual username on CS50 IDE in place of `USERNAME`.

== Specification

Implement in your `homepage` directory a website that must:

* Make a table using `<table>`, `<th>`, `<tr>` and `<td>`. Check out link:https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp[W3Schools] great tutorial! Try to style the table headers differently; make them bold and a different colour.
* Use at least ten (10) distinct HTML tags besides `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, and `<title>`. Using some tag (e.g., `<p>`) multiple times still counts as just one (1) of those ten!
* Contain at least two different `.html` pages, one of which is `index.html` (the main page of your website), and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.
* Have at least one stylesheet file (`styles.css`), which uses at least five (5) different CSS selectors (e.g. tag (`example`), class (`.example`), or ID (`#example`)), and within which you use a total of at least five (5) different CSS properties, such as `font-size`, or `margin`.
* No need to include any JavaScript on your site for this problem set, unless so inclined!

Optionally, you can try to do the following:
  
* Integrate one or more features from Bootstrap into your site. Bootstrap is a popular library (that comes with lots of CSS classes and more) via which you can beautify your site. See link:https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/[Bootstrap's documentation] to get started. To add Bootstrap to your site, it suffices to include
+
```
<link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
+
in your pages' `<head>`, below
+
```
<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
+
containing your own CSS.
* Ensure that your site looks nice on browsers both on mobile devices as well as laptops and desktops.

== Testing

If you want to view how your site looks while you work on it, there are two options:

1. Within CS50 IDE, navigate to your `homepage` directory (remember how?) and then execute
+
```
http-server
```
1. Within CS50 IDE, right-click (or Ctrl+click, on a Mac) on the `homepage` directory in the file tree at left. From the options that appear, select **Serve**, which should open a new tab in your browser (it may take a second or two) with your site therein.

In either case, you'll be brought to a URL of the form

```
http://ide50-USERNAME.cs50.io:XXXX
```

Where `USERNAME` is your username on CS50 IDE, and `XXXX` is either `8080` or `8081`, those referring to the _port number_ on which your web server is listening for requests (instead of the default `80` or `443` for HTTP and HTTPS requests, respectively). At that address, you'll see a listing of all of the files in your `homepage` directory, and from there can navigate to any HTML page you've created.
