# Section 3: Linear Search and debugging

For this section you (and two others) will complete up to three exercises (if it fits within the timeframe). You will first tackle and exercise about Linear Search, after which (if there is still time) your group will dive into the world of debugging with two exercises, in which you will help Tim and Simon (respectively) with fixing their programs.

## What to do?
1. Implement [Linear-Search](#linear-search)
2. Implement [Reverse](#reverse)
3. Implement [Matrix](#matrix)
