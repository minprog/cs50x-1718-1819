# Exercise 3: Matrix {#matrix}

## Goal

Help Simon debug his code. Simon wrote a program that creates a 2D array of dimensions X and Y, asks the user for a limit and then set all the entries in the array to 0 if they are below the limit.

## Getting started

### Download

    wget https://cs50x.mprog.nl/course/sections/03%20Search/matrix.zip
    unzip matrix.zip
    rm matrix.zip
    cd matrix

### Compile

    make matrix
    ./matrix

### Test

You can change the constants MATRIX_DIMENSION_X and MATRIX_DIMENSION_Y to play around with the program, maybe you can already get a feel for what's going wrong with Simon's software.

As with the previous exercise, the problem could be anywhere in Simon's code. There might even be multiple bugs...
