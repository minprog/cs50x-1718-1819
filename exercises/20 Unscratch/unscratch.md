# Exercises: Unscratch

## Goal

Your objective is to translate the following scratch programs into C. Interpret every `say` instruction as `printf` and end every `printf` with a new line.

## Getting started

If you haven't done so yet, create a directory called `practice` in your workspace:

    mkdir ~/workspace/practice

Create a directory `unscratch` in `practice` and step into it:

    mkdir ~/workspace/practice/unscratch
    cd ~/workspace/practice/unscratch

## Counter

Take a look at the following scratch program:

###Step 2:
Create a new file called `counter1.c` in the directory `unscratch` and recreate the scratch program above in C.

## Counter 2
