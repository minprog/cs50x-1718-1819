# CS50x University of Amsterdam

## Syllabus, Fall 2019<br><small>Programming 1, Programming 2</small>

Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches you how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python and SQL plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience.

## Expectations

You are expected to:

- watch all lectures,
- attend all sections,
- submit all problems,
- take all tests, and
- take a quiz.

You are also expected to attend the lab sessions as required, and for each problem set, discuss your feedback with your tutor or mentor.


## Asking Questions

The course's staff consists of your instructor and many teaching assistants. You are encouraged to speak to any of the staff at the lab to get help with problems or to ask questions about lectures.

Do you have a question in writing? Maybe need an exception? Feel free to send an e-mail to the course's heads via <help@mprog.nl>.


## Grades

All students must ordinarily submit a fully correct solution to all problems, take all tests and take the quiz in order to be eligible for a satisfactory grade unless granted an exception in writing by the course's heads.

The final grade for this course is primarily determined by averaging the scores for the problems, per the below. The tests and quiz have to be passed, but have no weight in the final grade.

#### Programming 1

| Problem Set            | Language | Weight |  
| ---------------------- | -------- | -----: |  
| Scratch                | Scratch  |     0% |  
| C                      | C        |    25% |  
| Crypto                 | C        |    25% |  
| Fifteen                | C        |    25% |  
| Forensics              | C        |    25% |  
| Mispellings (bonus)    | C        | 1 mark |

#### Programming 2

| Problem Set   | Language     | Weight |  
| ------------- | ------------ | -----: |  
| Homepage      | HTML         |     0% |  
| Python        | Python       |    25% |  
| Web           | HTML, Python |    25% |  
| Hangman       | Python       |    25% |  
| Adventure     | Python       |    25% |  

Know that this course draws quite the spectrum of students, including "those
less comfortable", "those more comfortable", and those somewhere in between.
However, what ultimately matters in this course is not so much where you end up
relative to your classmates but where you end up relative to yourself in Week 0.


## Lectures

Lectures discuss theory that helps you solve your problems sets and prepare you for the final exam. Watch the lectures before or on your way to the lab sessions, in order to be able to spend your lab time programming and asking questions.


## Tutoring sections

For hispeed only, lectures are supplemented by weekly, 60-minute sections led by the teaching assistants. Sections provide you with opportunities to explore the course's material in a more intimate environment, with only your tutor and a group of classmates present, as well as to dive into hands-on activities.


## Walkthroughs

Embedded into problem sets are "walkthroughs," videos via which the course's staff offer direction on where to begin and how to approach a challenge. You are expected to watch walkthroughs while starting with your problem sets.


## Office Hours

Office hours are opportunities for assistance with problem sets alongside the
course's teaching assistants. Office hours ordinarily take place on weekdays.


## Problems

Problems are the core of the course, enabling you to practice your problem solving skills. Problems are assessed primarily along axes of correctness, design, and style, with scores
ordinarily determined by the formula **3 × correctness + 2 × design + 1 × style**. Correctness for each submission is expected to be perfect.


## Exam

Both parts of the course have one 90-minute exam. It is "closed-book," meaning that you are allowed as attributes a pen or pencil, and nothing else. You can only take the exam if you have submitted all problems up until the date of the exam. Each student can have one exam resit per academic year.


## Schedule

For fulltime students, each module is due by a pre-set deadline. Late work is not ordinarily accepted, except in cases of medical emergency. A schedule of problem deadlines and quizzes, subject to change, appears below. All deadlines are at 23:59 on the date mentioned, or just a little bit later.

## Re-taking the course

Resubmission of problem sets is not possible after you complete the course successfully. Should you fail the course, the following rules apply when submitting any problem set for a second time:

- Resubmitting problem sets is not possible until the next semester.

- Re-submissions are required to be complete and bug-free, so as to not burden the staff with grading (i.e., correctness has to be perfect).

- Only correctness will be re-graded. Scores for design and style will not be changed even when you improve said design and style of your program (even though we do encourage this!).

- Any re-submissions must be done before retaking the exam.

- Problems cannot be submitted or graded a third time.


## Doing your own work {#academic_honesty}

This course's philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as "be reasonable." The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course's material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.

The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policy's other constraints. Collaboration on the course's test and quiz is not permitted at all.

Below are rules of thumb that (inexhaustively) characterize acts that the course considers reasonable and not reasonable. If in doubt as to whether some act is reasonable, do not commit it until you solicit and receive approval in writing from the course's heads. Acts considered not reasonable by the course are handled harshly.

### Reasonable

- Communicating with classmates about problem sets' problems in English (or some other spoken language).

- Discussing the course's material with others in order to understand it better.

- Helping a classmate identify a bug in his or her code at office hours, elsewhere, or even online, as by viewing, compiling, or running his or her code, even on your own computer.

- Incorporating a few lines of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code, provided that those lines are not themselves solutions to assigned problems and that you cite the lines' origins.

- Reviewing past semesters' quizzes and solutions thereto.

- Sending or showing code that you've written to someone, possibly a classmate, so that he or she might help you identify and fix a bug.

- Sharing a few lines of your own code online so that others might help you identify and fix a bug.

- Turning to the course's heads for help or receiving help from the course's heads during the quiz or test.

- Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course's own, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to problem set's problems or your own final project.

- Whiteboarding solutions to problem sets with others using diagrams or pseudocode but not actual code.

- Working with (and even paying) a tutor to help you with the course, provided the tutor does not do your work for you.

### Not Reasonable

- Accessing a solution to some problem prior to (re-)submitting your own.

- Asking a classmate to see his or her solution to a problem set's problem before (re-)submitting your own.

- Decompiling, deobfuscating, or disassembling the staff's solutions to problem sets.

- Failing to cite (as with comments) the origins of code or techniques that you discover outside of the course's own lessons and integrate into your own work, even while respecting this policy's other constraints.

- Giving or showing to a classmate a solution to a problem set's problem when it is he or she, and not you, who is struggling to solve it.

- Looking at another individual's work during the test or quiz.

- Paying or offering to pay an individual for work that you may submit as (part of) your own.

- Providing or making available solutions to problem sets to individuals who might take this course in the future.

- Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to problem sets online or elsewhere.

- Splitting a problem set's workload with another individual and combining your work.

- Submitting (after possibly modifying) the work of another individual beyond the few lines allowed herein.

- Submitting the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another.

- Submitting work to this course that you intend to use outside of the course (e.g., for a job) without prior approval from the course's heads.

- Turning to humans (besides the course's heads) for help or receiving help from humans (besides the course's heads) during the quiz or test.

- Viewing another's solution to a problem set's problem and basing your own solution on it.

### Regret clause {#regret}

If you commit some act that is not reasonable but bring it to the attention of the course's heads within 72 hours, the course may impose local sanctions that may include an unsatisfactory or failing grade for work submitted, but the course will not refer the matter for further disciplinary action except in cases of repeated acts.

### Brink clause

(This is an experimental feature of the course, which may be changed at some point.)

If push comes to shove, and you reach a breaking point this term, particularly late at night, and fear you're about to commit some act that is not reasonable, you may, up to the last moment before you cross that point of no return, email the course's heads to say that you see no other way out but invoke this clause. (And then go to sleep!) We will then meet with you and, together, get you back on track. For your honesty and your return from the brink, we will waive any penalty for lateness.
