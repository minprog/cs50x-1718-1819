# Module 9: Games

In this module, you'll implement two games, while learning about object-oriented programming. This style of programming isn't available in C, but in Python, many people use it!

## Help

For information on (or help with) this week:

1. Watch the walkthroughs included in all problems.

4. Ask questions during office hours using the "Ask" tool on this website.

5. Visit (or e-mail) the course's heads.

## Academic Honesty

Do keep in mind the course's policy on [academic honesty](/syllabus#academic_honesty) (like plagiarism), particularly its ["regret clause"](/syllabus#regret).

## Getting Started

Alright, here we go again!

Log into <https://cs50.io/> and execute the below in a terminal window.

    update50
    mkdir ~/workspace/module9/
    cd ~/workspace/module9s/

## What to Do

1. Watch:

    - All videos on [object-oriented fundamentals](https://www.lynda.com/Python-tutorials/Object-oriented-thinking/731735/5002881-4.html) (a menu of videos is on the right of the page)

    - All videos on [class diagrams](https://www.lynda.com/Python-tutorials/Creating-class-diagrams-Attributes/731735/5002911-4.html)

2. Create an account at [GitHub](https://github.com/join). For now, you'll only need it to access the Game of Cards exercises, but in later courses you'll be submitting your programs on this website!

1. Watch:

    - Intro to object-oriented programming in Python, [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYYzteRKU7U)

    - Optionally, intro to object-oriented programming in Python, [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYYzteRKU7U)

3. Practice with [Game of Cards](https://lab.cs50.io/uva/cs50x/master/problems/cards/lab)

4. Implement [Adventure](/problems/adventure)

## How to Submit

1. When ready to submit, log into [CS50 IDE](https://cs50.io/).

2. Download your `.py` files.

3. Make sure you are signed in to this website!

4. In the form below the problem, add the file that you downloaded.

5. Press "Submit for grading". Presto!
