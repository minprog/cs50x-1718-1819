# Module 1: C

In this module, you'll learn about the C programming language. It's a great language that has been used to make small and large programs alike. You will start with the small ones!


## Help

For information on (or help with) this week:

1. Attend your tutor's meeting.

2. Ask questions during office hours using the "Ask" tool on this website.

3. Visit (or e-mail) the course's heads in cases of emergency.


## Academic Honesty

Do keep in mind the course's policy on [academic honesty](/syllabus#academic_honesty) (like plagiarism), particularly its ["regret clause"](/syllabus#regret).


## What to Do

1. Watch [Lecture 1](/lectures/lecture-1)

2. Write your first program: [Hello](/problems/hello) [0%]

3. Practice with book chapter 1 (calculations) and take the test

4. Implement [Water](/problems/water) [0%]

5. Practice with book chapter 2 (logic) and take the test

6. Implement either of: [50%]

    - [Mario](/problems/mario-less), for those less comfortable

    - [Mario](/problems/mario-more), for those more comfortable

7. Practice with book chapter 3 (variables) and take the test

8. Implement either of: [50%]

    - [Cash](/problems/cash), for those less comfortable

    - [Credit](/problems/credit), for those more comfortable


## How to Submit

1. When ready to submit, log into [CS50 IDE](https://cs50.io/).

2. Toward CS50 IDE's top-left corner, within its "file browser" (not within a terminal window), control-click or right-click your `hello.c` file (that's within your `pset1` directory) and then select **Download**. You should find that your browser has downloaded `hello.c`.

3. Make sure you are signed in to this website!

4. In the form below the problem, add the file that you downloaded.

5. Press "Submit for grading". Presto!


## Grading

Above, the weight of each problem is noted. All programs have to be submitted in full in order to progress to the next module, which will be automatically checked using `check50`. Normally, you can see the results on this website soon after submitting.

Your tutor will assess your programs as soon as every student has finished the module, and assign a grade for "style" and "design" for all programs that count for more than 0% of the total (see above). Together with the `check50` results, this will add up to a grade for this assignment.
