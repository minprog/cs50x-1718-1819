# Module 3: Fifteen

In this module, you'll learn about arrays and about algorithms that you might implement in C. Searching and sorting algorithms will be part of many programs that you write!

## Help

For information on (or help with) this week:

1. Watch the walkthroughs included in all problems.

2. Attend your tutor's section (if you're hi-speed).

3. Use `help50` (if unsure what an error message means) and `debug50` (if your code is buggy).

4. Ask questions during office hours using the "Ask" tool on this website.

5. Visit (or e-mail) the course's heads.

## Academic Honesty

Do keep in mind the course's policy on [academic honesty](/syllabus#academic_honesty) (like plagiarism), particularly its ["regret clause"](/syllabus#regret).

## Reminders

Per [Lecture 2](/lectures/lecture-2):

* Use `help50` as needed.

* Use `eprintf` as needed.

* Use `debug50` as needed.

## Getting Started

Alright, here we go again!

Log into <https://cs50.io/> and execute the below in a terminal window.

    update50
    mkdir ~/workspace/pset3/
    cd ~/workspace/pset3/

## What to Do

1. Watch [Lecture 2](/lectures/lecture-2), from the previous module

2. Practice with the book chapter on *strings*, *arrays* and *functions*.

3. Implement [Fifteen](/problems/fifteen)

4. Implement either of:

    - [Find](/problems/find-less), for those less comfortable

    - [Find](/problems/find-more), for those more comfortable


## How to Submit

1. When ready to submit, log into [CS50 IDE](https://cs50.io/).

2. Download your `.c` files.

3. Make sure you are signed in to this website!

4. In the form below the problem, add the file that you downloaded.

5. Press "Submit for grading". Presto!
