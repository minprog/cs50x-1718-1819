# Module 7: Adventure

In this module, you'll implement two games, while learning about object-oriented programming. This style of programming isn't available in C, but in Python, many people use it!

## Help

For information on (or help with) this week:

1. Watch the walkthroughs included in all problems.

4. Ask questions during office hours using the "Ask" tool on this website.

5. Visit (or e-mail) the course's heads.

## Academic Honesty

Do keep in mind the course's policy on [academic honesty](/syllabus#academic_honesty) (like plagiarism), particularly its ["regret clause"](/syllabus#regret).

## Getting Started

Alright, here we go again!

Log into <https://cs50.io/> and execute the below in a terminal window.

    update50
    mkdir ~/workspace/pset7/
    cd ~/workspace/pset7/

## What to Do

1. Watch a video about the basics of [object-oriented programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apACNr7DC_s).

2. Create an account at [GitHub](https://github.com/join). For now, you'll only need it to access the Game of Cards exercises, but in later courses you'll be submitting your programs on this website!

3. Practice with [Game of Cards](https://lab.cs50.io/uva/cs50x/master/problems/cards/lab)

1. Watch:
