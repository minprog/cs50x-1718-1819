# Module 2: Crypto

In this module, you'll learn about cryptographic techniques and about strings in C. Strings will prove to be an important part of almost any program, indeed.


## Help

For information on (or help with) this week:

1. Watch the walkthroughs included in all problems.

2. Attend your tutor's section (if you're hi-speed).

3. Use `help50` (if unsure what an error message means) and `debug50` (if your code is buggy).

4. Ask questions during office hours using the "Ask" tool on this website.

5. Visit (or e-mail) the course's heads.


## Academic Honesty

Do keep in mind the course's policy on [academic honesty](/syllabus#academic_honesty) (like plagiarism), particularly its ["regret clause"](/syllabus#regret).


## Reminders

Per [Lecture 2](/lectures/lecture-2):

* Use `help50` as needed.

* Use `eprintf` as needed.

* Use `debug50` as needed.


## What to Do

1. Watch [Lecture 2](/lectures/lecture-2)

2. Learn how to update the [IDE](/training/updating)

5. Implement either of:

    - [Initials](/problems/initials-less), for those less comfortable

    - [Initials](/problems/initials-more), for those more comfortable

6. Practice with:

    - book chapter 4 (conditionals) and take the test

    - book chapter 5 (while loops) and take the test

    - book chapter 6 (for-loops) and take the test

7. Implement:

    - [Caesar](/problems/caesar)

8. Implement either of:

    - [Vigenere](/problems/vigenere), for those less comfortable

    - [Crack](/problems/crack), for those more comfortable


## How to Submit

1. When ready to submit, log into [CS50 IDE](https://cs50.io/).

2. Download your `.c` files.

3. Make sure you are signed in to this website!

4. In the form below the problem, add the file that you downloaded.

5. Press "Submit for grading". Presto!


## Grading

Above, the weight of each problem is noted. All programs have to be submitted in full in order to progress to the next module, which will be automatically checked using `check50`. Normally, you can see the results on this website soon after submitting.

Your tutor will assess your programs as soon as every student has finished the module, and assign a grade for "style" and "design" for all programs that count for more than 0% of the total (see above). Together with the `check50` results, this will add up to a grade for this assignment.
