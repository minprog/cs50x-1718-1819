# Module 2: Crypto

In this module, you'll learn about cryptographic techniques and about strings in C. Strings will prove to be an important part of almost any program, indeed.


## Help

For information on (or help with) this module:

1. Attend your tutor's meeting.

2. Use `help50` (if unsure what an error message means) and `debug50` (if your code is buggy).

3. Ask questions during office hours using the "Ask" tool on this website.

4. Visit (or e-mail) the course's heads in cases of emergency.


## Academic Honesty

Do keep in mind the course's policy on [academic honesty](/syllabus#academic_honesty) (like plagiarism), particularly its ["regret clause"](/syllabus#regret).


## Reminders

Per [Lecture 2](/lectures/lecture-2):

* Use `help50` as needed.

* Use `eprintf` as needed.

* Use `debug50` as needed.

## How to Submit

Instructions for submitting are included in the problem specifications as linked above.


## Grading

Above, the weight of each problem is noted. All programs have to be submitted in full in order to progress to the next module, which will be automatically checked using `check50`. Normally, you can see the results on this website soon after submitting.

Your tutor will assess your programs as soon as every student has finished the module, and assign a grade for "style" and "design" for your programs. Together with the `check50` results, this will add up to a grade for this assignment.
