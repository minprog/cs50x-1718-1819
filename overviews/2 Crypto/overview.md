# Module 2: Crypto

In this module, you'll learn about cryptographic techniques and about strings in C. Strings will prove to be an important part of almost any program, indeed.

## Help

For information on (or help with) this week:

1. Watch the walkthroughs included in all problems.

2. Attend your tutor's section (if you're hi-speed).

3. Use `help50` (if unsure what an error message means) and `debug50` (if your code is buggy).

4. Ask questions during office hours using the "Ask" tool on this website.

5. Visit (or e-mail) the course's heads.

## Academic Honesty

Do keep in mind the course's policy on [academic honesty](/syllabus#academic_honesty) (like plagiarism), particularly its ["regret clause"](/syllabus#regret).

## Reminders

Per [Lecture 2](/lectures/lecture-2):

* Use `help50` as needed.

* Use `eprintf` as needed.

* Use `debug50` as needed.

## What to Do

1. Watch [Lecture 2](/lectures/lecture-2)

2. Learn how to update the [IDE](/training/updating)
