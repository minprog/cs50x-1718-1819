## C

* Last week we used Scratch to better understand ideas and concepts in programming, like loops and functions.

* Today, we'll get an introduction to C, an older language, as another way of familiarizing ourselves with the tool of programming.

* We can start translating our simple programs from Scratch to C, the code of which is written purely in text.

* The `say` block in Scratch is a function, which the equivalent in C is the following:

		printf("hello,  world\n");

	* Notice that the function itself is called `printf`, and that the arguments, or parameters, to the function are wrapped inside symmetrical parentheses, `(` and `)`.

	* The double quotes, `"`, are also symmetrical and surround words, or any sequence of characters, in C. We'll start calling these sequences of characters *strings*.

	* The line also ends with a semicolon, which new programmers like us need to remember to include, but will come more naturally with practice!
