= Hello

== tl;dr

Implement a program that prints out a simple greeting to the user, per the below.

[source,subs=quotes]
----
$ [underline]#python hello.py#
What is your name?
[underline]#David#
hello, David
----

== Specification

* Write, in a file called `hello.py` in `~/workspace/pset6/hello`, a program that prompts a user for their name and then prints `hello, so-and-so`, where `so-and-so` is their provided name, exactly as you did in link:https://lab.cs50.io/cs50/labs/2018/fall/hello/[Problem Set 1], except that your program this time should be written (a) in Python and (b) in CS50 IDE.

== Walkthrough

**Note: The walkthrough video does not presuppose that you need to greet your user by name, but per this specification, your program should behave identically to that in Problem Set 1.**
