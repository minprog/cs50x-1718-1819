For help with Week 0 and Problem Set 0:

* Ask questions in class using the "Ask" tool on this website.
* Watch https://youtu.be/697pD31GCZg[Zamyla's walkthrough].
* Email or visit the course's heads.

== Academic Honesty

Do keep in mind the course's policy on link:/#academic_honesty[academic honesty], particularly its link:/#regret["regret clause"].

== Itching to Program?

It's time to choose your own adventure! Your assignment, quite simply, is to implement in Scratch any project of your choice, be it an interactive story, game, animation, or anything else, subject only to the following requirements:

* Your project must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.
* Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
* Your project must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.
* Your project must use at least one sound.
* Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than *Ivy's Hardest Game*. As such, your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.

Head to https://scratch.mit.edu/[the Scratch website] and sign up for an account on MIT’s website by clicking **Join Scratch** atop the page. Any username (that’s available) is fine, but take care to remember it and your choice of password.  After registering and confirming your email address, click the orange "**Start Creating**" button to begin.

Stuck for ideas? Here are your predecessors' https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/4248580/[projects from last year]. But try to think of an idea on your own, and then set out to implement it. However, don't try to implement the entirety of your project all at once: pluck off one piece at a time. In other words, take baby steps: write a bit of code (i.e., drag and drop a few puzzle pieces), test, write a bit more, test, and so forth. And select **File > Save Now** every few minutes so that you don't lose any work!

If, along the way, you find it too difficult to implement some feature, try not to fret; alter your design or work around the problem. If you set out to implement an idea that you find fun, odds are you won't find it too hard to satisfy the above requirements. 

Alright, off you go. Make us proud! 

Once finished with your project, select **File > Save to your computer**  and keep that file so that you can submit it below.  (That should download a file whose name ends in `.sb3`.) 

== How to Submit

Once finished with your project, click **See project page** in Scratch's top-right corner. Ensure your project has a title (in Scratch's top-left corner), some instructions (in Scratch's top-right corner), and some notes and/or credits (in Scratch's bottom-right corner). Then click **Share** in Scratch's top-right corner so that others can see your project. Finally, take note of the URL in your browser's address bar. That's your project's URL on MIT's website, and you'll need to paste that URL in the form below.

Also, from the Scratch editor, download your project as per "Download to my computer" in the **File** menu. Then, in the form below, upload the downloaded file and press Submit.

If you have any questions or issues with the above steps, reach out to the TAs or Heads!
