= Crack

== tl;dr

Implement a program that cracks passwords, per the below.

$ [underline]#python crack.py 51v3Nh6ZWGHOQ#
ROFL

== Specification

Design and implement a program, `crack`, that cracks passwords, exactly as you did in link:https://lab.cs50.io/cs50/labs/2018/fall/crack/[Problem Set 2], except that your program this time should be written (a) in Python and (b) in CS50 IDE..

* Implement your program in a file called `crack.py` in your `~/workspace/pset6/crack` directory (if it doesn't already exist, create it now!).
* Your program should accept a single command-line argument: a hashed password.
* If your program is executed without any command-line arguments or with more than one command-line argument, your program should print an error (of your choice) and exit immediately.
* Otherwise, your program must proceed to crack the given password, ideally as quickly as possible, ultimately printing the password in the clear followed by `\n`, nothing more, nothing less.
* Assume that each password has been hashed with C's DES-based (not MD5-based) `crypt` function.
* Assume that each password is no longer than five (5) characters. Gasp!
* Assume that each password is composed entirely of alphabetical characters (uppercase and/or lowercase).

== Walkthrough

**Note: The walkthrough video incorrectly states that passwords are no longer than four (4) characters. Instead, per the specification, make sure to handle passwords that are up to five (5) characters.**

== Usage

Your program should behave per the examples below. Assume that the underlined text is what some user has typed.

== Testing

=== Correctness

No `check50` for this one! But odds are, if you can crack all twelve passwords above, you're in good shape!
