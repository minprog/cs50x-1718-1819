# Quiz Prep

To prepare for the quiz, it's most important to have a good grasp of Python and object-oriented programming. "Adventure" should be fully done of course. Then, have a look at the example quiz, below.

1. Try to "program" all of the code questions on paper. Do not use any reference materials, give yourself an hour or so to really try to compose something coherent.

2. Then let it rest for a small while, and have a look at your "Adventure" code. Check how classes are defined and how these interact. What methods are there? From where are they called? What kind of data structures (lists, dictionaries) are there, and how are these used to contain all relevant data?

3. Try to finish your code questions again, after having looked critically at your assignments.

4. Discuss your solutions with another student or with someone from the teaching team.

5. Try to draw the UML diagram using the same strategy: no examples, just your present knowledge. Think about what you could include in the drawing and do it!

6. Carefully read the notes on the example UML diagram. Make sure you understand each part of the diagram and compare to your own version. Discuss.
